# ToyProject
This repository stores the toy project, sometimes for fun, sometimes for practicing my programming skills.

Each project would have description, solution and sometimes would have test outcomes.

Details can be found on Wiki. [Toy Project](https://github.com/jxcharlie1991/ToyProject/wiki)
